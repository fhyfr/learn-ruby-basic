# the difference between puts and print is
# puts automatically prints a new line after the end of a sentence
# print will prints the sentence in single line


# example of puts
firstName, lastName = "Firman", "Sah"

# the output is
# Firman
# Sah
puts firstName
puts lastName

# example of print
# the output is
# FirmanSah
print firstName
print lastName
